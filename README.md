In this challenge we were challenged with finding the trends of successful organizations that received their funding. This will be used to select funding receipients in the future based off of past data.

in the 'Starter_Code' file I process the data, create a starter learning model and test against the data finidng 73% accuracy.

in 'AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization' I created a model tuner to test a diverse set of models to find a more accurate model. The best model in this batch only tested at just under 73%, not even achieving results that the start model found.

you can find more thoughts on the testing and clearing in the 'report' file.

to complete the assignment I used a mixture of StackOverflow, google, and chatgpt for inspiration and troubleshooting.
